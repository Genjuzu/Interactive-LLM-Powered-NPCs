Baldur's Gate 3 is set in the dark, fantastical world of Faerûn, within the storied and dangerous region known as the Sword Coast. The narrative unfolds in a sprawling open world filled with magic, gods, political intrigue, and a history marked by both great heroism and devastating darkness. The Sword Coast, and especially the city of Baldur's Gate, serves as the focal point of this tale. Known as a place where adventurers gather, Baldur's Gate is a city of immense opportunity and treacherous secrets, teeming with people from across Faerûn, each with their own desires and dangers.

The Sword Coast lies along the western edge of Faerûn, bordered by the Sea of Swords. It is a region filled with vast forests, treacherous mountains, and bustling trade routes, all dotted with ancient ruins and guarded by remnants of lost empires. While the coast is known for its thriving trade and powerful cities, it is also home to deadly creatures, from goblins to trolls and dragons. The coast is divided into several major locations, each distinct in culture and atmosphere, ranging from the bustling metropolis of Baldur’s Gate to the shadow-cursed wildernesses and the cursed lands surrounding Moonrise Towers. The city of Baldur's Gate itself is the epicenter of trade, crime, and power on the Sword Coast.

Baldur's Gate is an independent city-state with a complex hierarchy, ruled by a council known as the Council of Four. The city is divided into three main areas: the wealthy Upper City, home to nobles and merchants; the bustling Lower City, filled with traders, artisans, and common folk; and the Outer City, where refugees, travelers, and less privileged inhabitants live. The city is protected by the Flaming Fist, a mercenary organization that enforces the laws of Baldur’s Gate but is known for its corruption and brutal tactics. The city itself is both feared and revered for its combination of opulence and danger, as powerful factions, mercenaries, and cultists vie for control.

Key Locations within Baldur’s Gate:

Upper City: The wealthiest part of the city, filled with grand estates, temples, and the mansions of the Patriars, Baldur’s Gate’s noble elite. It is a place of luxury and intrigue, where political power and wealth intersect, but access is limited, and the Flaming Fist guards this area closely.
Lower City: The heart of Baldur’s Gate, bustling with trade, marketplaces, and taverns. This is where most of the city’s business is conducted, and it is filled with artisans, merchants, and adventurers. However, it is also a place where crime is common, and the influence of various guilds and gangs is strong.
Outer City: A sprawling area outside the city walls, home to refugees, travelers, and those who are unable to afford residence within the walls. Here, life is harder, and protection is minimal, making it a breeding ground for unrest and cultist activity.
Beyond Baldur's Gate, the Sword Coast is dotted with important locations, each with its own unique dangers and allure:

The Shadow-Cursed Lands: A region haunted by dark magic and cursed shadows, where even daylight struggles to break through. Once vibrant, these lands are now under a curse that drains life and hope, and only the boldest venture into its depths. At the heart of these lands lies Moonrise Towers, a foreboding fortress that serves as a stronghold for sinister forces, including the Cult of the Absolute.

The Underdark: A vast subterranean world of darkness and danger, the Underdark is filled with exotic flora, strange creatures, and ancient cities like Menzoberranzan, home of the drow. This underground network connects to the surface in various places, and only seasoned adventurers dare to explore its depths, where both treasure and terror await.

Eldath’s Grove: A peaceful enclave dedicated to Eldath, the goddess of peace, hidden deep in the wilderness. This grove is a rare place of sanctuary, where druids and nature worshipers protect the balance of life. It also serves as a refuge from the encroaching dangers of the Sword Coast.

The Road to Elturel: Once a bustling trade route, this road now carries tales of the fall of Elturel, a nearby city that was dragged into the depths of the Nine Hells. Refugees from Elturel flood the Sword Coast, bringing with them stories of infernal powers and dark cults. Elturel’s fall has sent ripples through the region, and its shadow looms large in the minds of Baldur’s Gate’s people.

Moonrise Towers: Situated in the heart of the Shadow-Cursed Lands, this fortress is home to the followers of the Cult of the Absolute. The cult’s influence is rapidly spreading, bringing with it an air of dread. Moonrise Towers itself is said to be filled with powerful dark magic and cursed relics, and the cult’s ambitions threaten the entire Sword Coast.

The Flaming Fist: A mercenary force tasked with protecting Baldur’s Gate and maintaining order, the Flaming Fist operates as both the city’s military and police force. They wield considerable power, but their loyalty is frequently questioned, as corruption runs deep within their ranks. The Flaming Fist’s presence is both a blessing and a curse, as they often resort to brutal measures to keep control, particularly over the Outer City.

The Cult of the Absolute is a mysterious and growing force, using psionic mind-flayer tadpoles to spread its influence and recruit followers from all walks of life. These followers bear the mark of three interlocking circles and are granted powers by the strange parasite that binds them to the Absolute. The cult’s true intentions are shrouded in mystery, but its growth has made it a serious threat to the Sword Coast. The Cult is headquartered in Moonrise Towers and is rumored to have connections to ancient and dark powers that could change the fate of Faerûn.

Religion and Magic are deeply interwoven into the world of Faerûn. Gods are not just worshiped but are active forces, influencing events and granting powers to their followers. The Weave, controlled by the goddess Mystra, is the source of all magic, binding together the fabric of reality. Temples and shrines to deities such as Selûne, Tymora, and Bane can be found throughout the Sword Coast, each worshiped by people who seek their protection, fortune, or power. However, the influence of darker gods like Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal—the Dead Three—has been rising, particularly in Baldur’s Gate, where cults dedicated to these deities operate in the shadows.

The Political Climate on the Sword Coast is tense. With the growing refugee crisis, cult activity, and conflicts between factions, the region is on the brink of chaos. The various cities and factions, including the Flaming Fist, the Harpers, and the Zhentarim, all vie for control or influence, and alliances are fragile. The tensions within Baldur’s Gate mirror the broader struggles across Faerûn, where power, survival, and ancient magic shape the fate of its people.

In Baldur's Gate 3, players journey through this intricate world, facing both its wonders and horrors.
