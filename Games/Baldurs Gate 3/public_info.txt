Many of these tieflings have sought sanctuary in the wilderness outside Baldur's Gate, where they struggle to survive amid hostilities from local populations. Tensions have risen as these refugees are often blamed for bringing trouble, yet their plight has also garnered sympathy from some citizens who see them as victims of larger forces.

The Hag Coven is a group of hags who work together to expand their influence and spread fear among mortal populations. Hags are wicked, powerful creatures with a penchant for dark magic and manipulation. They are often found in remote swamps and forests, where they lure in the unsuspecting. Recently, rumors of a coven of hags operating near Baldur’s Gate have alarmed nearby villagers, who fear that these hags are spreading curses and abducting children.

The Ever-Abundant Pantheon reflects the diversity of beliefs across Faerûn. From the benign to the malevolent, gods and goddesses influence every aspect of life. The average citizen respects many gods, offering prayers to different deities depending on the situation. For instance, Tymora, the goddess of luck, is often worshipped by adventurers seeking her favor, while Chauntea, the goddess of agriculture, is honored by farmers hoping for a bountiful harvest. This open and inclusive approach to worship is a cornerstone of Faerûnian culture.

The Arcane Brotherhood is a group of powerful mages based in the far northern city of Luskan. Known for their ambitious pursuit of magical knowledge and influence, members of the Arcane Brotherhood often venture south in search of rare artifacts and spells. Their presence is both respected and feared, as they are known to pursue their goals with little regard for the consequences. Some suspect that the Brotherhood has interests in the magical upheavals near Baldur’s Gate.



Geography and Major Regions of Faerûn
Key Cities and Regions along the Sword Coast
Baldur's Gate: Baldur’s Gate is a large port city and a central hub of trade along the Sword Coast. Known for its extensive trade connections and political independence, the city is divided into the Upper City (home to the wealthy and nobility), the Lower City (where workers and merchants reside), and the Outer City (an unregulated area filled with immigrants, travelers, and outcasts). Baldur’s Gate has a reputation for rough edges and pervasive corruption, yet it is a magnet for adventurers seeking fame and fortune under the city's protection.

Waterdeep: Known as the "City of Splendors," Waterdeep is one of the largest and most influential cities in Faerûn. Governed by a council of Masked Lords whose identities remain secret, Waterdeep is famous for its magnificent monuments, a well-protected harbor district, and powerful magical wards. It serves as a center for politics, commerce, and adventuring opportunities, drawing individuals from all across Faerûn.

Neverwinter: Often called the "Jewel of the North," Neverwinter is a prosperous city located to the north of Baldur’s Gate. Known for its mild climate and beautiful architecture, the city has survived numerous disasters, including a volcanic eruption from Mount Hotenow. Neverwinter is known for its skilled craftsmen, thriving trade, and strong government led by Lord Neverember. The city is also rumored to have ancient links to powerful arcane forces.

Luskan: Known as the "City of Sails," Luskan is a rough, pirate-infested city north of Neverwinter. The city is infamous for its criminal underbelly and loose governance, with many districts controlled by pirate lords. Luskan is also home to the Arcane Brotherhood, a group of powerful wizards who are both respected and feared for their magical knowledge and influence over the region.

Notable Regions beyond the Coast
Amn: South of Baldur’s Gate lies Amn, a wealthy nation driven by commerce and trade. Its leaders are powerful merchant lords known as the Council of Five, who rule the land with a focus on expanding Amn's influence. The nation is known for its strict regulation of magic, enforced by the Cowled Wizards, who monitor spellcasters and control magical activities within Amn's borders.

The Dalelands: The Dalelands, located east of Cormyr, consist of a collection of fiercely independent villages and small towns. Known for their dedication to freedom, the people of the Dales are often at odds with neighboring kingdoms that attempt to control their lands. The Dalelands are also home to the ancient forest of Cormanthor, where the elven kingdom of Myth Drannor once flourished.

Anauroch: Known as the Great Desert, Anauroch was once a fertile land before it was transformed into a harsh desert by powerful ancient magic. It is inhabited by nomadic tribes, dangerous creatures, and the remnants of an ancient Netherese empire. The desert is a place of mystery and danger, filled with ruins and powerful relics of lost civilizations.

Chult: A distant, tropical peninsula to the south, Chult is known for its dense jungles, ancient ruins, and deadly creatures. Many adventurers journey to Chult in search of treasures and rare artifacts, but they must contend with its hostile terrain and dangerous wildlife, including dinosaurs and monstrous plants. The region is also home to powerful spirits and ancient temples dedicated to forgotten gods.

Significant Threat Zones
The Shadow-Cursed Lands: A region cursed by shadow magic, where sunlight struggles to penetrate. The Shadow-Cursed Lands are a dangerous area near Moonrise Towers, filled with twisted creatures, undead, and other dark entities. It is believed that an ancient ritual gone wrong caused the land to become tainted, creating a hauntingly cursed realm.

The Underdark: The Underdark is a vast, treacherous network of caverns stretching beneath Faerûn. It is home to dangerous beings such as drow, duergar, mind flayers, and beholders. The Underdark is a world of its own, shrouded in eternal darkness and governed by complex rivalries and alien politics. Few who enter return unscathed, as the depths of the Underdark hold secrets as dark as they are deadly.

Avernus: The first layer of the Nine Hells, Avernus is a scorched and war-torn realm ruled by devils. It is the site of the Blood War, an eternal conflict between devils and demons. Avernus became infamous recently when the city of Elturel was mysteriously dragged into its fiery depths, only to be miraculously restored to the Material Plane. The experience left many residents wary of infernal forces and cautious about dealings that might risk their souls.
